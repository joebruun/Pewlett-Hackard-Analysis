# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview/Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help Bobby setup a database that he can use to see different employee and department data. In addition, we are also helping Bobby track the number of employees by titles that are likley to retire soon so that he can potentially employ retirees in a part time mentorship program to help mentor new employees.  

## Results
The following information and tables are major points from the deliverables.

## Summary 

1. According to this analysis, as the "silver tsunami" wave begins, 90,398 roles will need to be filled to account for the retiring population. 
2. In total, there are 1,549 potential-retirees in the mentorship pool. The group of qualified, retirement-ready employees in various departments is much larger than the mentorship pool and, as a result, there are enough employees avaulable to mentor the next generation of P-H employees.
